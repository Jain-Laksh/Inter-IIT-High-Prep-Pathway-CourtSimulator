### Running the project: üöÄ

- Since Pathway is meant to be deployed in a containerized manner, and single-machine deployments can easily be achieved using Docker - we opted to make the whole app be able to run in a docker container. The dependencies are automatically installed into the container using the `requirements.txt` file.
- Therefore to run the project, you need to have **Docker** installed in your environment.
- First, go into the project directory, and setup a `.env` file (have to make the file) containing all the **API Keys** required to run the LLMs and fetching tools.:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY= <your_key_here>
GROQ_API_KEY= <your_key_here>
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY= <your_key_here>
SERPER_API_KEY= <your_key_here>
KANOON_API_KEY= <your_key_here>
// Other API keys for any LLM you would like to use
```

- Then, run the following command:

```terminal
docker build -t pathwaytest .
```

`pathwaytest` can be replaced with any name you want to give to the image.
Then, run the container with the following command:

```terminal
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 --rm --env-file .env pathwaytest
```

_Use the same name as above_, this will expose the backend FastAPI server at port 8000.
