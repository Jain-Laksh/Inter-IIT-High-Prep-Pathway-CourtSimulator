1. Review current state and plan a strategy
2. Identify the legal information needed to support the argument
3. Assess if information from the web is required
4. Argument construction

IMPORTANT NOTE: Do only 'current_task' at a time, other task will be done in next steps or other agents. Do not confuse with precedent cases. Avoid very long responses.
